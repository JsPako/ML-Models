# ML Models - Custom Written Algorithms in Python

This repository contains materials for the Manchester Metropolitan University Machine Learning Module.


## Assignment Task

The challenge in this assignment is to implement and demonstrate the training and prediction phases for a predictive
model of your choice, using Python. Your implementation only needs to support continuous numerical predictive features, and a range of suitable datasets are available for you to test with on Moodle. The only requirement is that your code must generate appropriate predictions given a particular set of training data. Processing time and other related side-issues donâ€™t matter.


## Algorithms

- k-Nearest Neighbours Classification
- Naive Bayes Classification
- Decision Tree Classification
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Artificial Neural Networks

    ### Extracurricular
    - k-Nearest Neighbours Regression
    - Decision Tree Regression
    - Support Vector Machine Classification

## Usage

To run an algorithm with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), 
```
Copy and paste the algorithm into a code cell
```
or use Python with the following dependencies:

```
  Python 3.10.11
  numpy 2.0.0b1
```
